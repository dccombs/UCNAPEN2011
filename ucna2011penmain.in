TITLE  Simple accelerator head and water phantom (step 1)
       .
       This example calculates the dose distribution in a water
       phantom from a simple electron accelerator model. The
       calculation is performed by running PENMAIN twice. A first
       run, with the input file 'accel1.in', generates a psf named
       'pm_psf_impdet_01.dat' at a plane beyond the bottom of the
       accelerator head. A second run of PENMAIN, with the input
       file 'accel2.in', reads initial particle states from that psf
       and produces the dose distribution in the water phantom.
